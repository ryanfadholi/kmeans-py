# K-Means Clustering (in Python)
A compact implementation of K-Means Clustering algorithm on Python using NumPy (and a dash of matplotlib).

The data included (in the text file) is a modified version of "Unbalanced" dataset provided in University of Eastern Finland's clustering benchmark datasets (https://cs.joensuu.fi/sipu/datasets/).
